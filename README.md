# Bayesian Learning and Boosting

# Assignment 1
Run `test_ml_estimates()`


# Assignment 2
Run `test_bayes_iris()` and `test_bayes_vowels()`

1. **When can a feature independence assumption be reasonable and when not?**
2. **How does the decision boundary look for the Iris dataset? How could one improve the classification results for this scenario by changing classifier or, alternatively, manipulating the data?**
